### June 2

- Download Processing from [here](https://processing.org/download). 
- Download and install Arduino from
  [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
  If you are on Windows chose either the
  Windows Installer ("Windows Win 7 and newer")
  or install from
  the Microsoft App Store ("Windows app Win 8.1 or 10")

#### Whatâ€™s the class about?

- Media with which we interact. This could be
	- Screen based
	- Physical with motors, lights, lasers
	- Non-technical, such as 
		- Signage (e.g. wayfinding)
		- Human traffic flow e.g. at an airport or a cafeteria

**Interactive Media is not just about technology**. It includes
- Design of physical objects
- Design of spaces
- Human computer interface
- Human human interface
- Information representation
- Ergonomics
- Inclusive design

What else can you think of that belongs on this list?

What kind of tools are useful in creating Interactive Media projects?
- Video
- Audio
- Touch screens
- Paper and pencil
- Our brains
- Talking to people who might use the end result
- Asking lots of questions
- Listening more than talking
- Testing ideas (prototypes) very early in the process, even before plans are
	complete (the plans could be based in faulty assumptions!)

What else can you think of that belongs on this list?

Arduino is just one of many tools that we find helpful

#### Introduction to Arduino

- IDE
- blink
	- Upload the Blink example
	- Change the parameter in delay()
	- Upload again and verify that the LED blinks at the new rate
- What is a program?
- What is a circuit?

What if want to work with more than just the LED on the Arduino?
- Arduino has many connections called *pins*
	- 20 pins
	- Arduino provides LED on pin 13
	- LED_BUILTIN = 13 

How will connect to these pins?

The most confusing part of this course is usually the solderless breadboard:

[SparkFun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)

Let's extend this circuit to the breadboard:

#### Digital Input

Adding a switch

![](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/media/ArduinoLEDMomentarySwitch_bb.png)

````
void setup() {
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(A2, INPUT);
}

void loop() {

  int switchPosition = digitalRead(A2);

  if (switchPosition == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  } else  {
    digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  }
}
````

An example:

````

const int pushButton = A2;
const int redLEDPin = A0;
const int greenLEDPin = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLEDPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLEDPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton);

  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(redLEDPin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, LOW);
    delay(300);
    digitalWrite(redLEDPin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, HIGH);
    delay(700);
  }
  allOff();
  delay(1000);
}

void allOff() {
  digitalWrite(redLEDPin, LOW);
  digitalWrite(greenLEDPin, LOW);
}
````

Other things you can do:

Add another LED on a different pin

Add another switch on a different pin

![](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_schem.png)
![](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/media/ArduinoTwoSwitches_bb.png)

#### In-class exercise

Now write a program that will blink different patterns depending on which
switch is pressed. 
Using two switches you can select between four patterns.
How is that possible?

#### Motor Driver 

Circuit Schematic

How did I choose which pins to use?
- Never use pins 0 and 1 (dedicated for USB communication)
- Avoid pin 13 if possible (it flashes 3 times on reset)
- Directional control pins (ain1, ain2, bin1, bin2) only require
	digital signals so avoid pins with extra functionality 
	(analog input, SPI, PWM)
- Inclusion of the servo library 
	disables `analogWrite()` on pins 9 and 10
	(I'm not using the servo library now but perhaps I'll add it later)
- Use of the `tone()` function 
	disables `analogWrite()` on pins 3 and 11
	(I'm not using the `tone()` function now but perhaps I'll add it later)
- This leaves PWM pins 5 and 6 for the speed controls (pwma and pwmb)
- Might as well choose nearby digital pins

Code

````

const int ain1Pin = 3;
const int ain2Pin = 4;
const int pwmAPin = 5;

const int bin1Pin = 8;
const int bin2Pin = 7;
const int pwmBPin = 6;


void setup() {
  pinMode(ain1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ain2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwmAPin, OUTPUT); // not needed really
}

void loop() {
  // turn in one direction, full speed
  Serial.println("full speed");
  analogWrite(pwmAPin, 255);
  digitalWrite(ain1Pin, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(ain2Pin, LOW);
  // stay here for a second
  delay(1000);

  // slow down
  Serial.println("slowing down");
  int speed = 255;
  while (speed--) {
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, speed);
    delay(20);
  }
}

````

Here is the code that Noah developed to control the motor speed and
direction using a potentiometer:

````
const int ain1Pin = 3;
const int ain2Pin = 4;
const int pwmAPin = 5;

const int bin1Pin = 8;
const int bin2Pin = 7;
const int pwmBPin = 6;

const int potPin = A5;


void setup() {
  pinMode(ain1Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ain2Pin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pwmAPin, OUTPUT); // not needed really
}

void loop() {
  int potVal = analogRead(potPin);
  delay(20);
  if (potVal > 1023 / 2) { //counterclockwise
    digitalWrite(ain1Pin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ain2Pin, LOW);
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, potVal / 4);
  } else { //clockwise
    digitalWrite(ain1Pin, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ain2Pin, HIGH);
    analogWrite(pwmAPin, 255 - potVal / 4);
  }
}

So much for blinking. What if we want to move a servo motor at the same time?
