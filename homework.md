#### Homework due Sunday June 11

Prepare a presentation on an artist of your choice that you think relates to
Interactive Media. Knowing that this is a very broad subject, you are free to
define Interactive Media as you wish. You may find some examples 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#whats-the-class-about)
and
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#inspiration-artists-movies-projects-etc), 
and of course Google (and maybe ChatGPT) will also be helpful.

Your presentation should be about 10 minutes long and should include:
- Four or 5 different works, including still photographs and/or videos
- The artist's inspiration, concept, motivation, philosophy - whatever they
  call it: Why do they do what they do, how do they see its place in the world
  of art, what are they trying to say, what are they celebrating or
  protesting, etc.
- The materials, technology, tools, and skills the artists use, if possible.
  Some artists are secretive about this, other are not
- Do the artists collaborate or work alone?
- Artist's background
- Whatever else you find interesting
