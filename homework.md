### Due June 12

1. Propose an artwork that uses technology in some way.
This is not something you will make, so it may require 
skills that you don't possess, but it should seem reasonably 
achievable with current technology (e.g. no perpetual motion or 
faster-than-light space travel). 

2. Read the rest 
(starting from "FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTION") 
of Don Norman's
[The Psychopathology of Everyday
Things](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/Norman-COGS1-ThePsychopathology-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)

### Due June 16

You are the director of a traditional museum,
such as the Islamic Art Museum. 
You have been charged with making changes to reach a younger audience 
(say 16 - 20)
which has a short attention span and has no patience for reading
or listening to long descriptions. The museum funders think that
you need to include "digital technology", but they don't know what that
means or how to include it.

Your assignment is to propose a solution, either using technology
or not. You must justify your solution based on your understanding 
of the behavior of this age group. 

You will work in groups:

Group A: Liza, Aadhar, Mbebo
Group B: Daniel, Adit
