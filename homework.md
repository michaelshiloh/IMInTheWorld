#### Homework due Sunday June 11

Prepare a presentation on an artist of your choice that you think relates to
Interactive Media. Knowing that this is a very broad subject, you are free to
define Interactive Media as you wish. You may find some examples 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#whats-the-class-about)
and
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#inspiration-artists-movies-projects-etc), 
and of course Google (and maybe ChatGPT) will also be helpful.

Let me know by the end of today (Wednesday) which artist you choose. Each of
you must select a different artist, so if you wait too long you might find
that your first choice is already taken.

Your presentation should be about 10 minutes long and should include:
- Four or 5 different works, including still photographs and/or videos
- The artist's inspiration, concept, motivation, philosophy - whatever they
  call it: Why do they do what they do, how do they see its place in the world
  of art, what are they trying to say, what are they celebrating or
  protesting, etc.
- The materials, technology, tools, and skills the artists use, if possible.
  Some artists are secretive about this, other are not
- Do the artists collaborate or work alone?
- Artist's background
- Whatever else you find interesting

#### Final project due Wednesday June 14

- Read 
[A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction
Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)
and
[A follow-up
    article](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/responses.html)
- You have witnessed many forms of interface designs at museums and galleries,
  in airports, buses, and restaurants; on websites, phones, and cash machines.
  Your final project is to design an interface for a new service (which you
  invent). Your interface should strive to be at the same time intuitive and
  novel, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. For those of you who can
  program I want to see a mock-up of this interface in Processing. For those
  of you for whom this class was your first exposure to programming, a drawing
  (hand or computer) is sufficient. 
- Create a brief presentation describing your service, your interface, and why
  you made the choices that you did.
