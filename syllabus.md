### Course Description:

"Interactive Media in the World" explores the principles of Interactive Media
put to use in the real world. Interactive Media is technology in the service
of inventors, artists, designers, developers, educators, and other creatives,
who use it to create experiences and devices that are insightful, critical,
and thought provoking.  Participants will learn the principles of Interactive
media (programming, electronics, and design) and how to prototype projects
rapidly. We will visit galleries, museums, studios, workshops, classrooms, and
labs. We will hear from artists, designers, inventors, teachers, and other
practitioners.  Israel/Palestine has a thriving art, design, and technology
scene and a large and diverse community of artists, educators, museums,
designers, inventors, and entrepreneurs. This provides an opportunity to
explore the contemporary world of Interactive Media where it is practiced and
installed in the field. Visits will include Jewish, Arab, and Palestinian
locations, and students who speak Arabic are especially encouraged to join.
Students will work both individually and in groups. Technical and critical
readings and discussion will culminate in a production project that will
respond to what we’ve learned.

### Course Learning Outcomes (Linked Program Learning Outcomes)

* Gain experience collaborating with others in both creative and technical
	processes (PLOs 7,8)
* Think critically about interaction design principles for physical interfaces
	(PLOs 2, 4)
* Work with basic electronics, including analogue and digital sensors and
	actuators (PLOs 5)
* Understand and be able to implement basic principles of computer
	programming, including working with objects and classes  (PLOs 5)
* Use a computer as a tool for self-expression (PLOs 6, 7)
* Bring information about the physical world (such as light, pressure,
	temperature) into the computer and process it in an interesting fashion
	(PLOs 5, 6)
* Research and develop an understanding of the practitioners and artifacts of
	Interactive Media (PLOs 1, 4,  7)

The Interactive Media Program Learning Outcomes (PLO) are described below:

Upon completion of the major in Interactive Media at NYU Abu Dhabi, all
students are expected to have fulfilled the following: 

1. Research and Understanding: IM students will cultivate a substantive
	 understanding of the past, present, and future landscape of Interactive
	 Media.
2. Analytical Thinking: IM students will be challenged to answer fundamental
	 questions relating to the field of Interactive Media.
3. Conceptual Thinking: IM students will develop conceptual skills through the
	 use of computational and interactive media tools to create project-based
	 work and project oriented research.
4. Critical Thinking: IM students will refine their critical thinking skills
	 by analyzing and critiquing work in cultural, social, historical, ethical,
	 and aesthetic contexts.
5. Technical Implementation: IM students will cultivate technical skills with
	 contemporary media technologies to execute their coursework.
6. Creative Processes: IM students will gain the ability to explore, innovate,
	 and realize creative ideas in multiple fields of inquiry and interest.
7. Organization and Communication: IM students will develop professional
	 practices of delivering and sharing their work.
8. Collaboration: IM Students will gain experience in collaboration through
	 active participation in group and team-based work.

### Teaching and Learning methodologies:

The philosophy of the Interactive Media program is that we learn best by doing
ourselves. While the main point of this course is to experience Interactive
Media in the world, we will best appreciate this when we ourselves have
learned and applied Interactive Media principles to create our own systems,
both individually and in collaboration with others. Thus, while the course
consists of lectures and other presentations by designers, artists, and other
practitioners, you are expected to get your hands dirty, to build circuits, to
write programs and to understand both the frustration of getting things to
work and the thrill when it all comes together. You will be doing work in and
outside of the class that is ideally experimental, participatory, and
collaborative. When technical content is delivered you will be expected to
work along with the lecture. Visits to workshops, labs, studios, and other
sites of creation, and conversations with the practitioners will give us
insight into the wide range of approaches. Critical skills will be developed
in discussion based on readings and presentations. Each student will make a
short presentation.

### Participation:

This class is highly interactive, and students are expected to engage
critically with the material by asking questions and by offering their
constructive insights, understanding, observations, and opinions to the
instructor, guest presenters, and fellow students. This engagement is required
and is part of the grade.

### Assignments and Grades

#### Grades

Class Participation 10%
Short Assignments 20%
Artist presentation 10%
Collaborative Projects 30%
Final Project 30%

#### Participation

A general rule about class participation is “quality is better than quantity.”
The following scale will be used to grade participation overall (on a scale of
1-10):

10: Excellent preparation by in-depth reading of the assigned material,
leads/contributes in a significant way to discussions, demonstrates consistent
active involvement, and offers thoughtful analysis and critique of the course
material.

8: Good preparation (knows facts, considers implications), offers
interpretation and analysis, leads/contributes well in discussion and is
consistently involved in the class.

6: Adequate preparation (knows basic facts of the readings but does not show
evidence of trying to interpret and analyze), does not participate voluntarily
in discussions, demonstrates sporadic involvement

4: Poor preparation (has a superficial knowledge and understanding of the
readings), tries to respond when called on, infrequent involvement in
discussions, or speaks without engaging with the reading or classmates’
comments.

2: Very poor preparation (no evidence for reading assigned material), does not
respond substantially when called on, participates very rarely in discussions.

0: No participation

#### Assignments

Short Assignments:  See the schedule below

#### Artist presentation:  
Each student will make a short (15 minute) presentation on an inventor, 
artist, designer, etc. of their choice

#### Collaborative Projects

- With Shenkar students: Each small group will design a system to address a
	particular interactive experience. The system may involve technology or may
	use other mediums.  Each group will present their work with a clear analysis
	of the problem they are addressing and how their system addresses it.  
- With Moona students: Each small group will design and construct a prototype
	mechatronic system. Each group will present their work with a clear
	explanation of the goal of the project and a description of how their system
	achieves that goal

#### Final Project:  
Students will work in groups to create a final project integrating multiple 
concepts learned in the course.

### Policy Statements:

#### Attendance Statement:

Due to the condensed nature of J-term, each absence is the equivalent of
missing a full week in a regular semester - with less of an opportunity to
make up for missed material. Each unex- cused absence results in the deduction
of one mark from the final course grade (e.g. from an A- to a B+). Excusing
absence is at the discretion of the instructor. Students who miss more than
three classes, excused or unexcused, cannot pass the course. If the absences
are ex- cused, the student will be withdrawn from the course. If more than one
of the absences is un- excused, the student will fail the course.

#### Academic Integrity:

At NYU Abu Dhabi, a commitment to excellence, fairness, honesty, and respect
within and outside the classroom is essential to maintaining the integrity of
our community. By accepting membership in this community, students, faculty,
and staff take responsibility for demonstrating these values in their own
conduct and for recognizing and supporting these values in others. In turn,
these values create a campus climate that encourages the free exchange of
ideas, promotes scholarly excellence through active and creative thought, and
allows community members to achieve and be recognized for achieving their
highest potential. As part of the NYU global network, NYUAD students are also
subject to NYU’s all-school policy on Academic Integrity for Students at NYU.
Alleged integrity violations are resolved using NYUAD’s Academic Integrity
Procedure.
